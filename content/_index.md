## *"Hey Meta, tell Home Assistant to turn on the lights"*

Metaphor is a walkthrough and documentation website to help you connect your Meta Glasses to all of your other apps.  Currently the glasses are only able to connect to other Meta apps:  Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.  Meta prefers you to use their own apps, but that creates limitations that make the glasses less useful than they could be.  If you want to control your smart home with Meta Ray-Ban glasses, or add a to-do item in Notion, or talk to ChatGPT, or create a Google calendar event, or have the top reddit post read to you every day at 9am, or send diary entries to a spreadsheet, or almost anything else you can imagine, this guide will explain how to do that.
