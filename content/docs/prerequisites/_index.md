1. Docker, Kubernetes, ProxMox, or some other container system and the knowledge to use it
2. Middleware like n8n, Zapier, IFTTT, or some other software that can accept a web request, parse it, and *do stuff* with it.  I use n8n and will show how to set that up, but I'm not going to explain how to install it.
3. A second WhatsApp account or a second phone number to create one.  I used a Google voice account to create a virtual phone number.
