title: The Guide
next: first-page

This guide requires that you have some reasonably strong technical skills.  You need to know how to create and manage Docker containers. You'll also need to understand how to parse JSON, how to make POST and GET requests between servers, and how to troubleshoot docker container logs if something goes wrong.  The guide is starting out pretty rough and I would REALLY appreciate you filling in the details and making corrections as you walk through the guide.  Just look for the *Edit this page in GitHub* link on the right (you can see it over there now!).  It will take you to GitHub where you can push a couple of buttons to fork the repo, edit and commit the page, then submit a pull request.  No need to drop to the command line and use git from there.  Thank you in advance for any contributions you make!
